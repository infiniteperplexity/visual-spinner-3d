<h2>VisualSpinner3D "Under the Hood."</h2>
The VisualSpinner3D engine is a complex beast.  This page &ndash; hopefully an evolving essay &ndash; aims to explain what's going on under the hood, in technical detail that may be of interest to both tech spinners and programmers.  Note that my model should probably be considered an extension or modification of Charlie Cushing's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL45D3844B85CB8D80">QFT</a> model, and was also influenced by videos and articles from <a href=" https://docs.google.com/document/d/11DVxKtISpmnmcHcKp9wDW_ysLeKluF2iESnhm7EqF2E/edit?pli=1

</p>
<p>
<p>
The universe of VisualSpinner3D consists of two types of things: <b>props</b> and <b>moves.</b>
</p>
<br>
<h3>Props:</h3>
<p>
The model treats all props &ndash; be they poi, staves, hoops, et cetera &ndash; as identical, except for how they look.  The most important thing we need to know about a prop is where it is.  How do we model that?  A poi has a handle, a head, and a tether that connects the handle to the head.  Many other props, even ones that don't have "heads" per se, can be thought of in the same way.  For example, a hoop's "handle" might be the place where you grip it, and its "head" might be the opposite end.
</p>
<p>
So if we want to know where a prop is, we need to know where its handle is and where its head is.  To model that in three dimensions, we could use familiar <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Three_dimensions>X, Y, and Z coordinates.</a>  For VisualSpinner3D, however, I chose to use <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system">spherical coordinates</a> instead.  Why?  Because spherical coordinates work very smoothly for modeling things that tend to travel in circular paths, like planets or, in this case, props.
</p>
<p>
Usually, when a prop moves, both the handle and the head move.  We can avoid some extra hassle by measuring the head's position relative to the handle &ndash; that is, we measure the handle's angle and distance from the origin, and then we measure the head's angle and distance away from the handle.  That way, when the handle moves, the head will always move along with it.  And instead of modeling a flower as a complicated, trigonometric <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid">cycloid</a>, we can think of it in a more intuitive way &ndash; a circular hand path combined with a circular prop path.
</p>
<p>
We could stop there, but in many cases, it's helpful to have more coordinates.  For example, if we want to model someone walking while they spin a prop, do we want to model the hand path as a cycloid?  Or, what if we want to model a move pivoted slightly to one side &ndash; wouldn't it be easier to think of this as pivoting in a straight line followed by spinning in a circle, rather than a complicated equation for a displaced circle?  In general, it's going to be easier and more intuitive to split these complicated motions into a larger number of simple parts, rather than trying to tie everything together into one, huge equation.
</p>
<p>
Through trial and error, I found that it's most convenient to model a prop as consisting of five "elements":
</p>
<p>
&rarr;"home"
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;"pivot"
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;"helper"
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;"handle"
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;"head"
</p>
<p>
...where the head is positioned relative to the handle, the handle relative to the helper, the helper relative to the pivot, and the pivot relative to home.
</p>
<p>
<b>Handle</b> and <b>head</b> we know.  <b>Home</b> roughly corresponds to the overall position of the human that is spinning the prop.  <b>Pivot</b> can model how someone might shift a move off to the side, or up or down. <b>Helper</b> is the oddball of the bunch, and is rarely needed, but it comes in handy for modeling certain very complex movements, such as fractal flowers or elliptical hand paths.
</p>
<p>
Using these "quintuple spherical coordinates," it is possible to model almost any prop movement as a simple combination of linear and circular motions.
</p>
<p>
We can make the model even more flexible by adding a few "extra" coordinates: "grip", "choke", "twist", and "bend."  <b>Grip</b>, <b>choke</b>, and <b>twist</b> all relate to various ways of holding a prop.  "Grip" is an angle between zero and 2&Pi; radians (360 degrees), which could represent any hand position along the circumference of a hoop.  Similarly, an angle of &Pi; radians (180 degrees) can represent holding a poi by the head instead of the handle, allowing us to convert any move into a contact move simply by changing one parameter.  "Choke" is a linear value representing how far up the "tether" the prop is held; this parameter allows us to model poi gunslingers, or different grips on a staff.  "Twist" represents rotating the prop around its own axis &ndash; irrelevant for poi or staff, but visually interesting for hoops and fans.  Finally, <b>bend</b> rotates the prop away from its own axis of motion.  This makes modeling plane-bent movements, such as toroids and weaves, much cleaner.
</p>
<p>
Strictly speaking, we could model absolutely any movement using only "head", "handle", and "twist."  But adding the additional, "unnecessary" parameters makes it possible to model even absolutely ridiculous movements &ndash; pirouetting in a circle while grip-shifting through pivoted toroids &ndash; by breaking them down into simple lines and circles.
</p>
<p>
Note a few limitations of this model:
<ul>
<li>
All props are modeled as rigid props, so it is not possible to model tangles (however, the radius of a prop is allowed to change, so it is possible to simulate the "look" of a spiral wrap.)
</li>
<li>
The engine models motion, not physics, so there are no sane limits on the possible.  Props can teleport or pass through each other, poi can spin upside-down pendulums, and so on.
</li>
<li>
The engine does not model the human body, so even though you can model the prop movement of, say, an angel roll or a four-beat windmill, you cannot model the relationship of those moves to the body.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Also note that this is not the only way prop movements can be formally modeled.  In particular, you may have seen <a href="http://www.drexfactor.com/weirdscience/2014/05/07/mathematical_approach_classifying_poi_patterns_modeling_flowers_and_third_or">Ben Drexler</a>, among others, model props using trigonometric functions parameterized with respect to time, using Cartesian coordinates.  That approach is both interesting and mathematically elegant for modeling flowers and certain other moves, but I found that it becomes unmanageably complex as a general tool for modeling prop movements.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
Moves:
</h3>
<p>
When a prop spinner speaks of "a move", they are typically referring to a series of hand and prop movements.  For example, a four-petal anti-spin flower describes a circular hand path spinning in one direction combined with a circular prop path spinning three times as fast in the other direction.  The move exists over a certain period of time; one "flower" normally refers to the movements of the hand and poi during the time it takes the hand to complete one full circle.
</p>
<p>
That's simply a convention.  We could just as easily divide the move into smaller motions, and instead of saying, "she spun an anti-spin flower," say, "she spun four anti-spin petals in a row."  And just as several petals can be sequenced together to create a flower, flowers and other moves can be sequenced together to create a performance.  This process can repeat without limit in either direction; a flower split into petals, and then each petal split into even briefer movements; or moves combined into routines, short routines combined into longer routines, and so on.
</p>
<p>
In computer science, this property is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability">composability</a>, and the resulting structure is called a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29>tree</a>; you could think of an entire performance as the tree, a C-CAP as a small branch, and the half-extension and half-antispin segments as leaves.  More specifically, a prop-spinning routine is an "ordered tree", which means every individual motion &ndash; the "leaves"  happens in a specific order.
</p>
<p>
In VisualSpinner3D, the "leaves"  called <b>MoveLinks</b>  contain simple instructions for the position, speed, and acceleration of the coordinates: home, pivot, helper, hand, prop, grip, choke, twist, and bend.  The "branches" are called <b>MoveChains</b>, and each MoveChain has a list of its contents, which could be any combination of MoveLinks or shorter MoveChains.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
Recipes:
</h3>
<p>
Even though we could combine movements into chunks of any size, it is easiest for spinners to think of them in terms of familiar "moves."  VisualSpinner3D models moves using <b>recipes</b>, which are sets of instructions for building a MoveChain out of MoveLinks.  For example, the "flower" recipe generates a number of petals (MoveLinks) and combines them together to form a flower (MoveChain.)  By default, the flower recipe creates a flower that has four in-spin petals in diamond mode, spins clockwise from the "3 o' clock" position in the wall plane, with a hand extension of one prop length, centered around the origin (roughly, the spinner's chest.)  But when you use a recipe, you can change any or all of these options; for example, you could change the "petals", "spin", and "entry" options to make a three-petal anti-spin flower that begins at the six o' clock position in the wall plane.  Different recipes have different options; for example, the "toroid" recipe has an option called "pitch" that describes which direction the prop bends toward (whenever possible I have tried to use terminology that already exists in the spinning community, but in some cases, such as the "pitch" of a toroid, I was not aware of any existing terms so I had to invent them.)
</p>
<p>
Recipes look something like this:
</p>
<code>
moves.build.flower({
<br>
&nbsp;direction: CLOCKWISE,
<br>
&nbsp;spin: ANTISPIN,
<br>
&nbsp;petals: 4,
<br>
&nbsp;mode: DIAMOND,
<br>
&nbsp;plane: WALL
<br>
});
</code>
<p>
Using recipes, you can generate complex "quintuple spherical" movements using keywords that make sense to spinners (you don't actually have to specify every option; for example, direction defaults to CLOCKWISE and plane defaults to WALL.)
</p>
<p>
When you give VisualSpinner3D a recipe, it builds a series of MoveLinks according to the options you provided and bundles them together in a MoveChain.  It also tags the MoveChain with a list of all the selected options, called the <b>definition.</b>  The definition isn't very appealing to the human eye...
</p>
<code>
{
<br>
&nbsp;"movename": "Four-Petal Anti-Spin Flower",
<br>
&nbsp;"recipe": "flower",
<br>
&nbsp;"spin": -1,
<br>
&nbsp;"petals": 4,
<br>
&nbsp;"orient": 0,
<br>
&nbsp;"entry": 0,
<br>
&nbsp;"duration": 1,
<br>
&nbsp;"extend": 1,
<br>
&nbsp;"direction": 1,
<br>
&nbsp;"mode": 0,
<br>
&nbsp;"plane": {
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"x": 0,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"y": 0,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"z": 1
<br>
&nbsp;},
<br>
&nbsp;"pivot_angle": 0,
<br>
&nbsp;"pivot_radius": 0
<br>
}
</code>
<p>
...however, this list tells VisualSpinner3D everything it needs to know about how to build that move from scratch.  That's helpful for a number of reasons.  First, it means we can "save our work" by exporting the text of the definition to a file, using a format called <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>, and re-load it later.  Second, it means the engine can tweak the move in order to ensure smooth transitions, using a system called <b>socketing.</b>
</p>
<br>
<h3>
Sockets:
</h3>
<p>
In real life, if I spin a diamond-mode, four-petal anti-spin flower, with an arm extension of one prop length, that ends in the 3 o' clock wall plane position, then the very next move I spin has to begin with both the hand and the prop in the 3 o' clock wall plane position, with the arm extended one prop length.  Otherwise, the prop would have to teleport!
</p>
<p>
VisualSpinner3D doesn't have to obey real-world physics, so teleporting props are a real possibility, especially if you sequence moves together without carefully choosing the right options.  Fortunately, VisualSpinner3D uses a system of <b>sockets</b> that makes things easier.  Each move has a starting and ending socket that describes where exactly the handle and prop head are located in three-dimensional space.
</p>
<p>
By default, when you add a move to a prop that already has a list of moves to spin, the engine compares the ending socket of the last move on the list to the beginning socket on the new move.  If they don't match, the engine will try to fix the problem by tweaking certain options on the new move until it finds a socket that fits.  Then it rebuilds the move according to the modified recipe.  If it can't find a socket that fits, it pops up an alert box warning you that the move doesn't fit and that the simulation won't look realistic.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
Code:
</h3>
<p>
VisualSpinner3D is written in JavaScript.  The engine consists of three scripts: <code>visual-spinner-engine.js</code>, <code>visual-spinner-moves.js</code>, and <code>visual-spinner-ui.js</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>engine.js</code> script defines the rules for how <code>Props</code>, <code>MoveLinks</code>, and <code>MoveChains</code> interact, the geometrical helper methods for encoding circular and linear motions, and the tools for importing and exporting JSON definitions.  It also contains a variety of useful constants, with names like <code>CLOCKWISE</code>, <code>OPPOSITE</code>, <code>ANTISPIN</code>, and so on, that translate spinning concepts into mathematical parameters (<code>CLOCKWISE</code> equals 1, <code>ANTISPIN</code> equals -1, and <code>OPPOSITE</code> equals 2&Pi; radians.)
</p>
<p>
The <code>moves.js</code> script defines all built-in recipes: flowers, CAPs, weaves, tosses, and all the rest.
</p>
<p>
The <code>ui.js</code> script defines the HTML5Canvas2dRenderer and the Phoria3dRenderer, which use two different graphics engines to animate props in either 2D or 3D.  It also defines a VisualSpinnerWidget that embeds a customizable VisualSpinner3D GUI element into a website.
</p>
<p>
A page that incorporates VisualSpinner3D needs a <code>/scripts</code> directory and should include the following code:
</p>
<code>
&ltscript&gtsrc="scripts/visual-spinner-engine.js">&lt/script&gt
<br>
&ltscript&gtsrc="scripts/visual-spinner-moves.js">&lt/script&gt
<br>
&ltscript&gtsrc="scripts/visual-spinner-ui.js">&lt/script&gt
<br>
</code>
<p>
The root JavaScript object of the VisualSpinner3D engine is called VS3D.  A new widget can be created like so:
</p>
<code>
var vs = VS3D.VisualSpinnerWidget();
<br>
vs.embedById("theIdTagOfSomeDivOnMyPage");
<br>
vs.addControls("play","pause","rewind","frame","forward","reset","2d3d");
<br>
</code>
<p>
Props and moves can be added like so:
</p>
<code>
var myProp = vs.addProp();
<br>
myProp.color = "orange";
<br>
myProp.addMove(VS3D.moves.build.flower({direction: VS3D.COUNTERCLOCKWISE, petals: 3, spin:  VS3D.ANTISPIN});
myProp.addMove(VS3D.moves.build.pendulum({speed: 2, duration: 0.25});
</code>
<p>
Or, you can add directly from a JSON file &mdash; perhaps one you exported from the composer:
</p>
</p>
<code>
vs.parseFile("mysavedroutine.json");
</code>
<p>
(As described earlier, in most cases the <code>Prop.addMove</code> method will automatically reorient the new move to match the ending socket of the existing list of moves.)
</p>
<p>
By default, the widget allows playback of a pre-specified sequenced of moves.  More advanced functionality, including menus, drag-and-drop, and other features seen on the various pages of this site, require custom JavaScript and fuller understanding of the VisualSpinner3D code base.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
Known Bugs:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<del>Some moves export to JSON incorrectly.  For example, if you export the routine from the "Comborific" page and try to reimport it with <code>parseFile</code>, the moves don't align correctly.  I suspect there may be something wrong with how the <code>phase</code> parameter is used.</del> Fixed!
</li>
<li>
I haven't done much testing of moves with <code>duration</code> longer than 2.  There may be some issues in that range.
