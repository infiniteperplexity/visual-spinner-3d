Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node, upon the first time I need it.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.  Much less of a problem now that I cache the fitted moes.
- linear movement is now broken and I barely care to fix it.
- not sure if radial acceleration units are correct
- Various fitting methods still don't handle plane breaks.
- GRIP is mostly untested.
- GRIP seems to display wrong for FLOOR plane, dunno why, something with bearings and angles.  Or maybe it's the optional planes per node?
- Consider implementing BEND as a node.
- Over and under-solving are causing recurring problems.
- Might want to actually make PIVOT named SHOULDER and so on.
- Does resolve() keep spin?
- I feel like that "special handling for last frame in a move" thing is playing with fire


Apps:
- Add the exhibit in once I first need it.
- Would be nice if we could export this stuff in a way that's actually kind of readable.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots, which may be related to the above.
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?
- The refitting approach I used to save the comborific.json got a few things wrong, including twist and a handful of positions.  This may not still be the case, though.
- SVG and WebGL occasionally get out of sync.

	Nice:
	- Might want to remove default properties when exporting.
	- Make looking at a move in the wrong plane more sensible.

	General:
	- Mucho testing.


- Do we need "insert a new move"?
- Check to see if we ever get "0 spin" label.
- Cumulative width is a bit off sometimes.
- Maybe let locking a node zeroify it?
- Speed display doesn't always round the way you'd like it to
- Make it possible to add more props, or delete them.
- Quite possibly should keep over spin and stuff like that.

- So...is there *any* way to make custom transitions easier?  Because they're the gnarly part right now.
	- Intelligent defaults: by default, use combinate?  That could save a lot of effort but...
		...it's a bit tricky to program.
		...it's a bit astonishing.
	- Make it possible to "reverse drag", such that child nodes are locked in place while parent nodes move.
		...you could make that mandatory for transitions.
			...that also gets rid of the "discarding" issue.
		...you could make it just a control-drag thing, for normal moves.
	- You could put some helpful tips on the screen.  For example, show starting and ending values for that node.
