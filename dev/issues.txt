Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node, upon the first time I need it.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.  Much less of a problem now that I cache the fitted moves.
- Various fitting methods still don't handle plane breaks (fits does check it correctly, but not bends)
- GRIP is untested in combination with BENT and TWIST.
- Might want to actually make PIVOT named SHOULDER and so on.
- Does resolve() keep spin?

Apps:
- Add video to the exhibit.
- Would be nice if we could export this stuff in a way that's actually kind of readable.

Bugs:
- The refitting approach I used to save the comborific.json got a few things wrong, including twist and a handful of positions.  This may not still be the case, though.

	Nice:
	- Might want to remove default properties when exporting.

	General:
	- Mucho testing.


- Maybe let locking a node zeroify it?

- Sure would be nice to remove zero nodes from the saved files.


*****TWIST & VT******

- Maybe we should fit twist whenever the plane doesn't change?


- I'm not sure if timecode shifting works how I want it, but it does kind of work.


- While editing, the "shadow" props always show up as poi.
