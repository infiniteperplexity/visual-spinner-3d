Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node, upon the first time I need it.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.  Much less of a problem now that I cache the fitted moes.
- linear movement is now broken and I barely care to fix it.
- not sure if radial acceleration units are correct
- Various fitting methods still don't handle plane breaks.
- GRIP is mostly untested.
- GRIP seems to display wrong for FLOOR plane, dunno why, something with bearings and angles.  Or maybe it's the optional planes per node?
- Consider implementing BEND as a node.
- Over and under-solving are causing recurring problems.
- Might want to actually make PIVOT named SHOULDER and so on.
- Does resolve() keep spin?
- I feel like that "special handling for last frame in a move" thing is playing with fire


Apps:
- Add the exhibit in once I first need it.
- Would be nice if we could export this stuff in a way that's actually kind of readable.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots, which may be related to the above.
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?
- The refitting approach I used to save the comborific.json got a few things wrong, including twist and a handful of positions.  This may not still be the case, though.
- SVG and WebGL occasionally get out of sync.

	Nice:
	- Might want to remove default properties when exporting.
	- Make looking at a move in the wrong plane more sensible.

	General:
	- Mucho testing.


- Fix the scrollbar thing.
- Duration adjustment is ugly.
- Do we need "insert a new move"?
- Check to see if we ever get "0 spin" label.
- Cumulative width is a bit off sometimes.
- Maybe let locking a node zeroify it?
- Speed display doesn't always round the way you'd like it to
- Make it possible to add more props, or delete them.
- Make other prop types possible.
- Quite possibly should keep over spin and stuff like that.
