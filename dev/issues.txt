Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node, upon the first time I need it.
- Might want to make units more readable for vl and vr.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.  Much less of a problem now that I cache the fitted moes.
- Should extend() wrap around?


Apps:
- Integrate it with React.
- Add the exhibit in once I first need it.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots.
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?

- It seems like prop.toXYZ and move.toXYZ might be good things, 

React:
	- need rounding that snaps to grid.
	- coordinate system is upside down.
