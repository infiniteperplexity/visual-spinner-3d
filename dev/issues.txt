Dev:
- Wow, the fan toroids actually look good in the old engine.
- That exhibit is a useful thing.
- Overlay should maybe have its own methods.

Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.
- Should extend() wrap around?
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?

Apps:
- Integrate it with React.
- Do more with overlays.
- Finish the other apps.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots.
- Might want to make units more readable for vl and vr.


- Should reorganize the engine code
