Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node, upon the first time I need it.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.  Much less of a problem now that I cache the fitted moves.
- Various fitting methods still don't handle plane breaks (fits does check it correctly, but not bends)
- GRIP is mostly untested.
- GRIP seems to display wrong for FLOOR plane, dunno why, something with bearings and angles.  Or maybe it's the optional planes per node?
- Consider implementing BEND as a node.
- Over and under-solving are causing recurring problems.
- Might want to actually make PIVOT named SHOULDER and so on.
- Does resolve() keep spin?
- Maybe linear acceleration works now?

Apps:
- Add the exhibit in once I first need it.
- Would be nice if we could export this stuff in a way that's actually kind of readable.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots, which may be related to the above.
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?
- The refitting approach I used to save the comborific.json got a few things wrong, including twist and a handful of positions.  This may not still be the case, though.
- SVG and WebGL occasionally get out of sync.

	Nice:
	- Might want to remove default properties when exporting.
	- Make looking at a move in the wrong plane more sensible.

	General:
	- Mucho testing.


- Do we need "insert a new move"?
- Look for ugly speed labels of various kinds
- Maybe let locking a node zeroify it?
- Make it possible to add more props, or delete them.
- Quite possibly should carry over spins and stuff like that.

- Other planes are mostly untested.
- Grip is mostly untested.

Planes:
	- extending moves doesn't extend the plane.
	- Seems to snap back.
	- Seems dangerously breakable to show moves in the wrong plane.
	- Probably need some kind of alert that like "hey, this ending is not compatible at all with the prior plane"
	- Idea: special iconography for plane break?


addMovesToEnd:
	- Do you add based on the selected plane or the last plane?
	- What if things are incompatible?

modifyMoveUsingNode:
	- What do you do when the plane differs from the existing one?
		- Redo every single node?
	- What if things are incompatible?

setDuration:
	- Just need to propagate it.

modifySpins, modifyAcceleration:
	- Just need to propagate it.

validateTransition and deleteTransition might get crazy.

deleteMove could create inconsistencies.

insertMove could create inconsistencies.

copyDraggedMove could create inconsistencies.

setPropNodesByTick probably needs to account for plane

Problem that arose using editor.

(getting a weird error at this part...NaN shoulder speed, when it should have been sliding (radius change))..best solution would be to refactor the code
(custom transition failed to update a shoulder point)


- Make sure I pushStoreState for changing moves.
- Scroll when you click a thing that's near the edge of the screen.
- Maybe should drag using tethers, in case something gets pulled off screen?
- Should there be a speed indicator for custom transitions?  Eh...like an asterisk or exclamation point or something?
