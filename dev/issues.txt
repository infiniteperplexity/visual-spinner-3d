Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node, upon the first time I need it.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.  Much less of a problem now that I cache the fitted moes.
- linear movement is now broken and I barely care to fix it.
- not sure if radial acceleration units are correct
- Various fitting methods still don't handle plane breaks.
- GRIP is mostly untested.
- GRIP seems to display wrong for FLOOR plane, dunno why, something with bearings and angles.  Or maybe it's the optional planes per node?
- Consider implementing BEND as a node.
- Over and under-solving are causing recurring problems.
- Might want to actually make PIVOT named SHOULDER and so on.
- Does resolve() keep spin?


Apps:
- Add the exhibit in once I first need it.
- Would be nice if we could export this stuff in a way that's actually kind of readable.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots, which may be related to the above.
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?
- The refitting approach I used to save the comborific.json got a few things wrong, including twist and a handful of positions.  This may not still be the case, though.
- SVG and WebGL occasionally get out of sync.

React App:
	Core:
	- +s to add props.  -s?
	- Make moves deletable.
	- Make moves insertable.
	- Multi-Selection and copying?
	- Make moves drag-rearrangeable.

	Nice:
	- Might want to remove default properties when exporting.
	- Make looking at a move in the wrong plane more sensible.
	- Border boxes separating sections.

	General:
	- Mucho testing.

	- Want controls for adjusting beats / ticks.
	- Clock at 3pm (circle with l-shape) is clock symbol. Or, 11:15, to make it halvable.
		- Click on icons to rotate?
		- Next icon is visible in gray?
		- Drag to stretch.
		- Drop-down menu?
		- Number input?


- Speed display doesn't round the way you'd like it to
- Need to figure out how to import/export transitions.

- What are the basic functions?
	- Delete.
	- Insert before.
	- Either, drag to rearrange, or <- ->

- Could do it with delete box and drag handles, and insert box.

Next up:
	- Duration adjustment
	- Selection/insertion stuff.
	- Maybe zeroify a node by clicking?
	- Things are a bit confusing, if you create a transition where you're off a different angle from zero.
	- Cumulative move width is very slightly off
	- transition selection tick should say so explicitly
	- dragging the other prop while in transition mode can get weird.
