Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node, upon the first time I need it.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.  Much less of a problem now that I cache the fitted moes.
- linear movement is now broken and I barely care to fix it.
- not sure if radial acceleration units are correct
- Various fitting methods still don't handle plane breaks.
- GRIP is mostly untested.
- GRIP seems to display wrong for FLOOR plane, dunno why, something with bearings and angles.  Or maybe it's the optional planes per node?
- Consider implementing BEND as a node.
- Over and under-solving are causing recurring problems.


Apps:
- Integrate it with React.
- Add the exhibit in once I first need it.
- Would be nice if we could export this stuff in a way that's actually kind of spinnable.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots, which may be related to the above.
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?
- The refitting approach I used to save the comborific.json got a few things wrong, including twist and a handful of positions.  This may not still be the case, though.
- SVG and WebGL occasionally get out of sync.
	- I'm seeing something where you click on a node that is in both props???

- The juggling page is broken now, almost certainly because it violates the "only one radius changes" combinating assumption.  Was there way around that one?  Ugh...I really don't like these situations where I can't remember how the fitting algorithms work.


React App:
	Core:
	- +s to add props.  -s?
	- Make moves deletable.
	- Make moves insertable.
	- Multi-Selection and copying?
	- Make moves drag-rearrangeable.

	Nice:
	- Might want to remove default properties when exporting.
	- Make looking at a move in the wrong plane more sensible.
	- Border boxes separating sections.

	General:
	- Mucho testing.

	- Brigid doesn't like the ff-style acceleration arrow
	- modifying a move should move the player to the beginning of it.


	- Want controls for adjusting beats / ticks.
	- Clock at 3pm (circle with l-shape) is clock symbol. Or, 11:15, to make it halvable.
		- Click on icons to rotate?
		- Next icon is visible in gray?
		- Drag to stretch.
		- Drop-down menu?
		- Number input?


One idea for maintaining solved state:
- If va & va1 are both zero, completely re-solve without respecting spins.
- Otherwise, try to respect spins:
- If va was zero, try to keep va at zero.
- Otherwise, if va1 was zero, try to keep it at zero.
- Otherwise, if va===va1, re-solve.
- Otherwise, try to keep va as-is.
