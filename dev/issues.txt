Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node, upon the first time I need it.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.  Much less of a problem now that I cache the fitted moes.
- linear movement is now broken and I barely care to fix it.
- not sure if radial acceleration units are correct
- Various fitting methods still don't handle plane breaks.
- GRIP is mostly untested.
- GRIP seems to display wrong for FLOOR plane, dunno why, something with bearings and angles.  Or maybe it's the optional planes per node?

Apps:
- Integrate it with React.
- Add the exhibit in once I first need it.
- Would be nice if we could export this stuff in a way that's actually kind of spinnable.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots, which may be related to the above.
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?
- The refitting approach I used to save the comborific.json got a few things wrong, including twist and a handful of positions.

- It seems like prop.toXYZ and move.toXYZ might be good things, 


React App:
	Core:
	- The "combinate" algorithm now exists but I don't use it.
	- +s to add props.  -s?
	- locks shouldn't be allowed when r is not zero.
	- change how linear and radial speeds look

	Nice:
	- Make sure all panel elements work.
	- Make sure you can't modify the first move.
	- Better player controls.
		- Should block / alter use of some / most other controls?
		- Should it start at current tick?
	- Make it so you can change prop colors.
	- Might want to remove default properties when exporting.
	- Have the import do resolving and validating.
	- Make looking at a move in the wrong plane more sensible.
