Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node, upon the first time I need it.
- Might want to make units more readable for vl and vr.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.  Much less of a problem now that I cache the fitted moes.
- Should extend() wrap around?


Apps:
- Integrate it with React.
- Add the exhibit in once I first need it.
- Would be nice if we could export this stuff in a way that's actually kind of spinnable.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots, which may be related to the above.
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?
- The refitting approach I used to save the comborific.json got a few things wrong, including twist and a handful of positions.

- It seems like prop.toXYZ and move.toXYZ might be good things, 

React:
	- Modification panel.
		- Activate it.
	- Some sort of visual representation on the move list.
	- Make better player controls.
		- Should block / alter use of some / most other controls?
		- Might need to override / wrap existing onclicks;
		- Should it start at current tick?
	- Color menus
		- Change color of props
		- Toggle other color menus
	- Want more area on the SVG grids.
	- Make locking and unlocking manual.
	- Some of the planes might be backwards.

	- Maybe make the different nodes look different.
	- Get icons from noun project for viewing angle.
	- Would be nice if SVGs rendered according to depth.
	- conforming 0s is sometimes the wrong approach; should check fit first.

	- Probably want to add moves two at a time.
	- Things get weird when you have selected the "wrong" prop for starter moves? (error not reproduced)

	- Okay.  So, the layout is total garbage, and that's maybe the next thing to fix.
