Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node, upon the first time I need it.
- Might want to make units more readable for vl and vr.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?  Probably not, given that object spread is the single biggest performance hog.  Much less of a problem now that I cache the fitted moes.
- Should extend() wrap around?


Apps:
- Integrate it with React.
- Add the exhibit in once I first need it.
- Would be nice if we could export this stuff in a way that's actually kind of spinnable.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots, which may be related to the above.
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?
- The refitting approach I used to save the comborific.json got a few things wrong, including twist and a handful of positions.

- It seems like prop.toXYZ and move.toXYZ might be good things, 


React App:
	Core:
	- Might want to propagate starting angular speed by default (easy enough, only for new moves added to end.)
	- The conform-vs-fits issue is actually a really thorny one.
	- Might want to use tickboxes for unlocking and locking elements.

	Nice:
	- Make sure all panel elements work.
	- Make sure you can't modify the first move.
	- Visual representation on move queue.
	- Better player controls.
		- Should block / alter use of some / most other controls?
		- Might need to override / wrap existing onclicks;
		- Should it start at current tick?
	- Make it so you can change prop colors.
	- More area on SVG grids.
	- A few planes are backwards.
	- Maybe make the different nodes look different.
	- Get icons from noun project for viewing angle.
	- Would be nice if SVGs rendered according to depth.
	- Might want to remove default properties when exporting.
	- Have the import do resolving and validating.
	- Make it so import can be done using popup.
	- Make it so import and export are React-ier.


	Solving the node-sum problem:
	- Toggleable manipulation of beginning nodes.
		- Head and hand stay frozen...does that work?
	- Smart defaults, auto-back-propagating?
		- Algorithm
			- Try extending the ending non-zero abstract nodes backwards.
			- Try zeroing out combinations of other abstract nodes in some order to find fits()
				- Doesn't guarantee a solution, but might usually.
