Floor toggles at 181 as well.
WHEEL and WALL don't toggle at 181.
FLOOR is actually -90 in the front half...and yes, _FLOOR reverses that.
Likewise, _WALL and _WHEEL flip their things.

So that's interesting...we've got differences of 36 and then 9 between the diagonals and the cardinals on one side.
But then this big huge gap after the z-flip.

Ohhhhkay.  So, 359 in the WHXFL plane looks exactly wrong with 225, even though 0 looks exactly right.  359 looks exactly right with 45.

So it seems like maybe we flip over over 180?  Yeah...above 180, or below 0, we subtract 180
