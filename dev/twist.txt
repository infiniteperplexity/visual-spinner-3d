Floor toggles at 181 as well.
WHEEL and WALL don't toggle at 181.
FLOOR is actually -90 in the front half...and yes, _FLOOR reverses that.
Likewise, _WALL and _WHEEL flip their things.

So that's interesting...we've got differences of 36 and then 9 between the diagonals and the cardinals on one side.
But then this big huge gap after the z-flip.

Ohhhhkay.  So, 359 in the WHXFL plane looks exactly wrong with 225, even though 0 looks exactly right.  359 looks exactly right with 45.

So it seems like maybe we flip over over 180?  Yeah...above 180, or below 0, we subtract 180


Okay, let's look at the wheel/floor plane graphs.  So, the really obvious thing is you add 180 if the result is below 180.  So let's counteract that.

Alright.  So what I'm thinking is that WALL and WHEEL and everything in between are special cases.  The general case between WHEEL and FLOOR seems to be that there's a really big peak up near the WHEEL plane and a straight line down at the FLOOR plane.  It may be a sine wave?  With amplitude maybe...the z-ness of the plane?

There's a 90-degree span between FLOOR and WHEEL at 180.  It ranges from 270 to 360.  And when the plane is halfway between, the peak is halfway between.  Ranges from 45 to -45.  So...square the z component and multiply by 45, that's the amplitude.

Okay this is looking a lot like the negative cosine.  So...270-cos(angle)*90*zsquared

Okay, here's from someone who probably has the right answer.

1) We're using z as up/down.
2) We're looking at the longitude line that's q radians from 1,0,0, which happens to be bearing b
3) Great circle is defined by normal vector, with weird restriction that z is positive.  Wait, that's y, so not so weird.
4) Math.PI - Math.acos


let bearing;
let {x, y, z};
let angle = (Math.PI-Math.acos(arcbounds(
	Math.cos(bearing*UNIT)*z - Math.sin(bearing*UNIT)*x
	/ (x*x+y*y+z*z)
)))/UNIT;

That seems wrong for the equator, except...
The angle that the two great circles cut out should be pi minus the angle between two vectors perpendicular to planes containing those great circles.

Then the plane through the origin and containing the longitude line you care about is
-(sin q)x+(cos q)y=0,
so a vector perpendicular to that plane is:
<-sin q, cos q,0>.

The plane through the origin containing the great circles is
ax+by+cz=0,
so a vector perpendicular to that plane is <a,b,c>.

For any two vectors <u1,u2,u3> and <v1,v2,v3>, neither of which are zero, the angle between them in radians is:
arccos[(u1v1+u2v2+u3v3)/([u1^2+u2^2+u3^2][v1^2+v2^2+v3^2])].
Now put <u1,u2,u3>=<-sin q,cos q,0> and <v1,v2,v3>=<a,b,c> to get the formula I said.


I may be misunderstanding something about the setup, but that equation doesn't seem to work for the equator.  The equator should cut out the same angle for every longitude line, but as you go around the equator, q is changing while all the other terms in the equation stay the same.
