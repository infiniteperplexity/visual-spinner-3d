WHXFL:
0: 225 :      bearing 90, angle 90.\par
45: 234~
90: 270
135: 306~
180: 315

181: 134~
225: 126~
270: 90
315: 54~
359: 45~



So that's interesting...we've got differences of 36 and then 9 between the diagonals and the cardinals on one side.
But then this big huge gap after the z-flip.

Ohhhhkay.  So, 359 in the WHXFL plane looks exactly wrong with 225, even though 0 looks exactly right.  359 looks exactly right with 45.

So it seems like maybe we flip over over 180?  Yeah...above 180, or below 0, we subtract 180
