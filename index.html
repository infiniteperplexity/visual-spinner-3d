Welcome to the home page for the VisualSpinner3D project!
</h1>
<br>
<p>
Q: What is VisualSpinner3D?
</p>
<p>
A: VisualSpinner3D is a prop-spinning simulator, written in JavaScript, that can visualize almost any sequence of moves - flowers, pendulums, hybrids, and so on - for any number of props.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Q: Who are you?
</p>
<p>
A: My name is Glenn Wright.  I'm a fire spinner and a programmer, and I live in Oakland, California.  You can contact me at infinite D0T perplexity AT gmail D0T com.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Q: Where can I see the simulator in action?
</p>
<p>
A: The short answer is, right here!
</p>
<div id="vs-div"></div>
<p>
The long answer is trickier.  The simulator is a JavaScript engine that can simulate almost any combination or sequence of moves.  But, with so many possibilities, it's hard to design one set of buttons and menus that allows users access to the full power of the simulator in an intuitive way.  For that reason, I have written a number of demo pages that show off the engine's possibilities:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://infiniteperplexity.github.io/visual-spinner-3d/demo.html">This page</a> is probably the easiest interface for a new user to play around with.  A set of menus lets you pick prop types, moves, spin directions, starting positions, planes, and the like.</li>
<li><a href="http://infiniteperplexity.github.io/visual-spinner-3d/spinmorepoi.html">This page</a> is a variation on the page above, formatted for Willow Solow's <a href="http://www.spinmorepoi.com/theory/">Spin More Poi</a> site.  It also happens to fit quite well on an iPhone screen.  If you're at a spin jam and you just want to show someone what a triquetra looks like on your phone, this is a good place to start.</li>
<li><a href="http://infiniteperplexity.github.io/visual-spinner-3d/comborific.html">This page</a> models Ben Drexler's mind-blowing "Comborific" video, slowing down things so you can understand every move and transition.</li>
<li><a href="http://infiniteperplexity.github.io/visual-spinner-3d/composer.html">This page</a> is the most powerful interface I have built so far, but it's also a bit more complex than the other pages.  You can drag and drop moves from a list, modify them, arrange them in sequences, and even export a text file that you can reload the next time you visit the page.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
Q: Can I incorporate VisualSpinner3D in my own web site?
</p>
<p>
A: Yes!  This page shows how easy it is to embed a VisualSpinner3D player.  Note that VisualSpinner3D is currently released under the GNU General Public License, which means you cannot charge money for a program that incorporates the VisualSpinner3D engine.  However, I am planning to change the licensing so that the engine can be incorporated in commercial software, so long as the engine itself remains free.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Q: Is the code open source?
</p>
<p>
A: Yes, and it is available on <a href="https://github.com/infiniteperplexity/visual-spinner-3d">my Github site.</a>
</p>
<p>
The code for the engine itself is basically finished, but there is a whole world of possibilities for improved graphics and interface design.  For example, the only reason the simulator currently doesn't do fire fans is that they're too hard for me to draw.  If you're good at this sort of thing, then contact me and let's fix that!
</p>
<p>
Q: Why does your page look terrible?
</p>
<p>
A: Because web design is not my strong suit.  This is another area where I appreciate the suggestions and charity of others.
