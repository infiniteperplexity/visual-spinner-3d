	- only beats inferred in "spin".
	- many defaults injected in node$spin.
	- "fit" branches off.
		- many injected into fit.
		- many injected into realign.
	- alias and solver used in node$spin.
	- zeroes injected in motion$rotate.
	- Should use merge uniformly.
	- Also create a Node constructor?
	- maybe "alias" should accept a variety of lookup tables
- add PolarGridHelper
- finish nudge
- moves in other planes not working right
