Dev:
- Allow truncated moves.  "beats" is the way to do this...I dunno about like, entry though.
	- We essentially don't need realign if we use ENTRY.
- Wow, the fan toroids actually look good in the old engine.
- Test out multi-view.
- How do I handle t overflow?
- That exhibit is a useful thing.
- Overlay should maybe have its own methods.

Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?
- Should extend() wrap around?
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?

Apps:
- Get multi-view working.
- Comborific.
- Integrate it with React.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots.

Ideas:
- Make it so props use the same data structure as moves.
	- Have to rewrite a ton of stuff.
	- Fewer conversions needed.
	- Positions are non-unique.
	- Prop can have twist and bend natively.
	- Against this, we have this general idea that...like...props are for reading, moves are for writing?  Certainly it gets harder when you don't treat it that way.
