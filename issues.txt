Engine:
- Figure out TWIST
- Allow optional planes per node.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?
- Should extend() wrap around?

Bugs:
- Probend toroids look wrong, unless we use shims.  Why???


Apps:
- Get multi-view working.
- Comborific.
- Integrate it with React.

Ideas:
- Make it so props use the same data structure as moves.
	- Have to rewrite a ton of stuff.
	- Fewer conversions needed.
	- Positions are non-unique.
	- Prop can have twist and bend natively.
	- Against this, we have this general idea that...like...props are for reading, moves are for writing?  Certainly it gets harder when you don't treat it that way.
