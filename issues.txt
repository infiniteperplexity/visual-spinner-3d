Dev:
- Allow truncated moves.  "beats" is the way to do this...I dunno about like, entry though.
	- We essentially don't need realign if we use ENTRY.
	- Could also just maybe hack it into fit().
- Wow, the fan toroids actually look good in the old engine.
- That exhibit is a useful thing.
- Overlay should maybe have its own methods.

Engine:
- Allow optional planes per node.
- Are defaults injected in the right places?
- Should extend() wrap around?
- All breaks in angle$spherify are gone, but are there maybe still cusps?

Apps:
- Get multi-view working.
- Comborific.
- Integrate it with React.

Bugs:
- TWIST still looks wrong in parts of WHXFL plane.
- Fan-based toroids flicker in certain spots.

- Omg...linear isolations look just fine using only angular movements.
- Would be really nice to just roll with beats: 1 by default...
