- Comborific.
- Integrate it with React.
- Get the grip stuff working right.
- I should probably try to inject defaults in some smarter place.
	- only beats inferred in "spin".
	- many defaults injected in node$spin.
	- "fit" branches off.
		- many injected into fit.
		- many injected into realign.
	- alias and solver used in node$spin.
	- zeroes injected in motion$rotate.
	- Should use merge uniformly.
	- Also create a Node constructor.
- We've got rounding errors kicking my butt.
