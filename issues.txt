Engine:
- I think I un-added vb and vt...
- Fitting and orientation still doesn't always work as expected.
- Add linear movements.
- Get the grip stuff working right.
- Make solver deal with loops.
- Finish "nudge".
- Are defaults injected in the right places?

Moves:
- Add more moves.

Render:
- There is a flicker-to-zero in TWIST at a=0 that seems proportional in size to the x-component of the planar axis.
	- So, really bad in WHEEL plane.
- Add non-WebGL fallback.
- figure out render order.

Apps:
- Get the demo working.
- Get multi-view working.
- Comborific.
- Integrate it with React.


Bugs:
- spinmorepoi demo doesn't convert starting positions in WHEEL or FLOOR plane correctly.
- an error when selecting floor plane triquetras might be caused by that
