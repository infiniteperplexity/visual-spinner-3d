Engine:
- Chaining toroids resets the bend at each cusp...using shims for now
- Not totally sure whether alignment always works correctly.
- Add linear movements.
- Get the grip stuff working right.
- Make solver deal with loops...I just add the 1.5 variant for pendulums, which is a good test case.
- Finish "nudge".
- Are defaults injected in the right places?

Moves:
- Add more moves.

Render:
- Weird flicker when TWIST is not zero.
- figure out render order.

Apps:
- Add more moves to demo.
- Make orientation menus actually work.
- Get multi-view working.
- Comborific.
- Integrate it with React.


Bugs:
- I'm relying on hideous shims for bent and plane$reference.
- prop$set does weird things to the hand node when you only pass a head node...worked around it for now


Today's notes:
- Allow optional planes per node.
- !!!Some moves don't have fixed starting positions; e.g. flowers.  So pass hand.a and head.a?
- TWIST should radiate from UP to DOWN, so the WHEEL and WALL planes are usually correct but FLOOR needs rotating.
- Bent is from grip, TWIST might be as well.
