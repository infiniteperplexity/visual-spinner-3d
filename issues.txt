Engine:
- Chaining toroids resets the bend at each cusp...using shims for now
- Get the grip stuff working right.
- Finish "nudge".
- Are defaults injected in the right places?
- Should extend() wrap around?

Render:
- Weird flicker when TWIST is not zero.

Apps:
- (! only once bend and toroids are fixed) Make orientation menus actually work.
- Get multi-view working.
- Comborific.
- Integrate it with React.


Bugs:
- I'm relying on hideous shims for bent and plane$reference.


Today's notes:
- Allow optional planes per node.
- TWIST should radiate from UP to DOWN, so the WHEEL and WALL planes are usually correct but FLOOR needs rotating.
- Bent is from grip, TWIST might be as well.

Next step?  A bunch of this stuff is all linked together.
