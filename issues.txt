* Get C-CAP fully working.
- Add more moves.
- Get the demo working.
- Get multi-view working.
- Comborific.
- Integrate it with React.
- Get the grip stuff working right.
- I should probably try to inject defaults in some smarter place.
	- only beats inferred in "spin".
	- many defaults injected in node$spin.
	- "fit" branches off.
		- many injected into fit.
		- many injected into realign.
	- alias and solver used in node$spin.
	- zeroes injected in motion$rotate.
	- Should use merge uniformly.
	- Also create a Node constructor?
	- maybe "alias" should accept a variety of lookup tables

- Ah yup.  We're running into the multiple solutions problem, I think.
