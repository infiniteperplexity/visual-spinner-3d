# Summary

Buugeng or S Staves are a flow toy similar to isolation hoops. These are not properly scaled or tested and will undergo further development as I continue to improve my 3d modeling knowledge. My goal is to produce printable sets that can collapse or disassemble for easy travel and will have recesses to install magnets to keep the two halves together during performance. Most sets available online are expensive due to the material intensive nature of their shape and I think it would be excellent to have other options available.

There is a lot of room for improvement and I encourage anyone with the aptitude and skill to use this as a starting point to improve upon the design.

To do:
- Slice and key the curved arms for easy assembly and disassembly.
- Make recesses for neodymium magnets.
- Investigate modifications to reduce the amount of material needed to print a complete set.
